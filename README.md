# Tiffany's Website

## Project Description
This project is a multipage website built as part of the final project for the course. It includes a Home, About, and Contact page, and demonstrates the use of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Design Choices
I chose a minimalistic design with a clean layout and a black and orange color scheme to enhance readability and user experience. The site maintains a consistent theme across all pages to ensure a cohesive look and feel. The design is also fully responsive, making sure it looks good and functions properly on devices of all sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Features Implemented Using JavaScript
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that the user's input meets the required criteria before submission.
- **Autoplay Videos**: Integrates MP4 videos that autoplay in a loop without sound.
- **Modal Toggling**: Adds interactivity by toggling the visibility of a modal window.

## Media Gallery
The home page features a dynamic media gallery using CSS Flexbox to display images and videos uniformly. Each media item includes a comment for context and description.

## Deployment
The website is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed at [Link to Live Website](https://tiffanyweb.netlify.app/). 

### Deployment Challenges
I initially faced challenges deploying the website using GitHub Pages and Vercel due to authorization issues. The PLP-WebTechnologies repository was denying Netlify authorization as well. To overcome this, I created my own repository for deployment, which resolved the authorization problem.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PLP-WebTechnologies/safaricom-hook-final-project-and-deployment-week-8-Tiffany-kay.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Open `home.html` in your web browser to view the site.
